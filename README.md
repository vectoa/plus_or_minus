# plus_or_minus
A simple command-line game written in Rust. The goal is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## 🎮 How It Works

- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The user inputs a guess.
- The program tells you if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

## 🚀 Run the Game

Make sure you have Rust installed. Then simply run:

```bash
cargo run
